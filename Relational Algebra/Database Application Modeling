Database Application Modeling for Soccer Players and Relational Algebra Excersises

Part 1
Player (Name, Age, countryName)
Country (Name, confederationName)
ConFed (Name, President)
Club (Name,  countryName, clubPresident) // since Club is a weak entity the key for this table also includes references to the key in Country table 
InClub (playerName, clubName, clubCountryName) // all three columns required to represent a unique entity

Part 2
 
A+ → A
B+ → B
C+ → C x D x A  - translates to C→C, C→D, C→A 
D+ → D x A - translates to D → D, D→A
// from the given FDs only this new FD is non-trivial since the other derived FD’s are already given
Answer: C→A 


A+ → A
B+ → B
C+ → CDA
D+ → DA
AB+ →  ABCD
AC+ →  CDA
AD+ → DA
BC+ → ABCD
BD+ → ABD
CD+ → ACD
Answer: AB, BC  are minimal attributes that cover all relations so they are the keys
Answer: ABC, ABD, BCD, ABCD // these are set of attributes that cover the relations but they are not minimal so they are superkeys

Part 3
C→D , D→A, C→A // while considering the relations ABCD, AB is the key but from C → D, D->A, and C->A are not the keys for relation ABCD so they violate BCNF 
 // for relation ABCD, AB is key but C->D is not so we split ABCD into CDA (corresponding to C+) and BC. In CDA, D→A is not a key so we again split to get CD and DA. Now all FD relationships are keys. To check the AB→C FD is okay since AB are not together, C→D is okay since they are together, D→A is okay since they are together, and C→A is okay since CA is not together.
	Answer: BC
 CD
 DA
